                <h1>Higher Education</h1>

                <p>Education is one of, if not the most important part of a person's life. Most of the populace spends approximately a quarter of their lives in pursuit of a degree; a qualification provided to students upon completion of a course of study. My father is a firm advocator for higher education; he himself possesses double Master's in Political History and Journalism. My father was the first one in his family to receive formal education and understands the importance of it. He has always supported and encouraged me to do the same. I aspire to follow in his footsteps. 
                </p>

                <p>My love for science is hard to describe in words. I have always been curious about anything to everything. I suppose it's ingrained in human nature. After school, I would spend most of my free time watching documentaries and scientific shows on National Geographic Channel. I would learn about the age of inventions, technological advancements, and great minds who were behind those creations. I would idolize Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla.
                </p>

                <p>After watching documentaries on their lives, I concluded that all great minds and scholars possess a degree in their respective fields. A degree is not just a piece of paper; it is an attestation of your conviction and commitment to something you believe in. In this age of booming technology where everything is just a click away, I want to leave my mark, my legacy. 
                </p>

                <p>Legacy is a concept relative to the person. For someone it might be leaving an abundance of wealth for future generation or accepting a noble prize and etching your name in history or being a loving husband and endearing father. To me legacy is leaving the world better than I found it. Even if I might not be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor, I want to leave it one step closer for the next generation and I want to know that I did everything in my power to accomplish that goal.
                </p>

                <p>I dream of someday to hold a PhD in Genetic Engineering, a PhD in astrophysics, and a bachelor's in computer science. I want to use all my knowledge to help humankind as a whole move forward. I have pondered about the implications of this journey and the time commitment, and it reminds me of a quote from someone I hold dear to heart.
